# LINKLIST
Linklist programs
1) Add Node at End with Tail Pointer
2) Print ith position element in LInklist
3) Delete the ith position element in Linklist
4) insert at ith position in LL
5) Length of LL recursively
6) Insert node at ith position in LL recursively
7) Delete node at ith position in LL recursively
8) find index in LL recursively
9) Append Last n node at head in LL
10) remove duplicate in sorted LL
11) remove duplicate node in unsort LL using hash
12) remove duplicate node in unsort LL using pointers
13) Print LL in reverse order
14) Merge two sorted Linklist
15) File rev_ll.c contain both method to reverse linklist : recursive and iterative
